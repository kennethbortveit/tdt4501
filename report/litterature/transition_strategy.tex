\chapter{Transition Strategy}
In order to make interoperability possible one as to transition from the old way of doing to the new.
And with a transition I talk about taking the system as it is and change it to something new. It's the process from old to new.
The process of transforming systems or system migration if you will.
\section{An overview}
Making a transition involves a switch from the old system to the new. This switch is usually refered to as the cutover.
