Our idea was to make a webapp that will cover Randys requirements.\\

I started programming the GUI while Simen took care of the database.
Here the complications startet. We need a way to push datagroups into the other DHIS2 instance.
The web API does not support this.
So in order to do this we have to directly access the database.
