\subsection{Starting on the interoperate ability project}
We discussed what the requirements for our case should be.
Randy wants to be able to transfer data groups from one DHIS2 instance to another.
We started to make some ideas and landed on making a web app. There were several good options.
\subsubsection{Android App}
This one we disqulified pretty early on. I think it was because it is kind of separate from DHIS2.
\subsubsection{Web App}
We thought this would be a good idea. This can easaly be integreted later on as a DHIS2 app and then run as a part of DHIS2.
\subsubsection{DHIS2 App}
The app framework is was not great for our purposes so we could not use it yet.
