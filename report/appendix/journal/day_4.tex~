\subsection{1st session: Review of training}
The datamanagers from different facilities reviewed their previos training. See email from Gloria for more information.
Wheres the map? (Because they removed it.)\\
Inser chart list maybe to long.\\
Why is the top border gone in gis? (Problem solved)\\
Wheres the back button? (Found it!)\\

\subsection{Meeting}
We talked a little bit here in order to get a better understanding of how they used the DHIS2. The consisted of me, Simen, Gloria, Adolf and three other data managers. It was a little difficult at first, but after a while I think we've got a pretty good understanding of it. They use DHIS2 for data analyses and for reporting data. Reporting data is done by the data manager at each health facility. Data analysing is used by monitoring and evaluation officer and head of community officers for decision making and strategic planning. \\

The collecting of data starts in paper form. They are then gathered at each facility for reporting in the DHIS2 database. They have a seperate reporting system with voxivia. They still use this because they allow for more detailed information. If they use DHIS2 they have to track the reporting to the paperbased forms in order to get the ground details. Adolf mentioned that he would like a way to combine the data from the tracker and the aggregated data. This was a nice feature that they would like.
\subsection{Dinner}
Dinner was awsome!
\subsection{Second Session}
We then had a look at their presentations. We only stayed for one presentation. Then it was photo's. Thumbs up Simen!

\subsection{MSC Office}
We set up at the Management Sciences of Health office. We met alot of new people. Mircel, I don't really know what he does yet. Think it was finance. Felix, good to meet him again. Bob the american. Cedrick and Emmir. Cedrick is a little shorter than Emir. And some other people.\\

\subsection{After Brunch}
After Randy's meeting we talked a little more about the projects that are relevant. The malaria surveliance and the interoperateabillity. I want the Malaria Surveliance. This would give us a concret assignment and a `know when its done' thing. The interoperateability would probably give us the best learning experience. Because it challenges me to think at computer systems at a higher level. I will send an email to Eric and discuss it further. I have a feeling I wont enjoy the best choice. Nappolina is the project manager.
\subsection{Conference room}
Randy gave us a briefing about the 2 remaining projects. This was alot of information to take in. 
\subsubsection{Malaria Active Surveliance}
The want to copy an existing report to a web based solution. Where this should be, I do not know.
\begin{itemize}
\item HTML
\item DHIS2
\item Mobile SMS
\item App
\end{itemize}
This was an extensive report. Randy proposed that we should mayby trim down the report a little. I think we've got the report on an email.
\subsubsection{Sentinal Surveliance}
This system is awsome. It's purpose is to collect weather and malaria data in order to see if theres an corelation between the two. They are going from 11 to 16 sentinels nationally.

\subsubsection{Ineroperateability}
Then got of to discuss the interoperateability project.
For starters Randy wanted to make a report based on some choosen indicators.
The task goes something like this.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load data from dictionary
\item Choose indicators
\item Choose metadata/attributes
\item Produce report (Maybe with a preferred layout)
\end{enumerate}
He then explained how he wanted the entire system to work.
The result would be something like this.

\end{figure}
I think I should reaad up on SQL. It seem that this would be relevant.
For the last part he talked about how he would like to synchronize changes made to certain data element groups, cross instances of DHIS2. This in the case of adding adding elements. Would he like the same thin for indicators, I do not know. 
\subsection{Dinner at Randy's}
