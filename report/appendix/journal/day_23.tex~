\subsection{HMIS Staff meeting}
We dicussed several things. Was kind of hard to pay attention since I was about to say something in front of the whole group and I was very nurveous. At least I got the information needed in order to continue mapping all the systems. Edith should be able to provide the necessary information about the external entities. 
\subsubsection{Agenda}
\begin{itemize}
	\item DHIS2 Version 2.13 Demo
	\item Indicator list to load into datawarehouse
	\item DHIS2 Transitions
	\item Training plans
	\item Mapping of all DHIS2 interoperatability requirements
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Malarya Surveliance}
This meeting generally was about outside my current scope. It is really hard to pay attention when there is so much I cant relate to. We got a copy for the reporting of malarya cases. We discussed how we should proceed. A task that could be relevant for me is implementing the sms reporting service. I should also look at the tracker in DHIS2, so I am aware of it's functionality.
\subsection{Meeting with Jean Paul}
Jean Paul is a representant from IHRIS. He gave us some information abour how IHRIS is sending data to the dataware house.
I were after very specific information so the meeting didnt take long. 
After talking about that I tried to understand IHRIS future plans. Seems like they also want to exchange data with some external entities. This led me to the fact that there are even more entities that would like to participating in data exchange.
\subsection{Skype with Bob}
After a long conversation with Bob(Jo) from Dublin I realized that again we were victims of rework. Bob had already made the necessary code for updating the Resource Mapper. This is awsome. Saves us from alot of work. I begin to notice that awareness is key to avoid rework, but it is very difficult. Staying updated on everybody's work is almost a full time job. Maybe it should be. It looks like Bob want me and Simen to make to make a GUI based on he's script/application. In the future maybe this application could make data exchange possible between all the different systems.
