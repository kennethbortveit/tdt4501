\subsection{Starting today's work}
Today we had a heated discussion regarding how to proceed. I still think that we should proceed, but in a slightly different manner. Simen think that users should be able to make the dataelements manually. I think it should be automated. We are now back on a research face where we explore different options. Olav is working on something similar and Bob has suggested that we should maybe colabborate with him.
