\subsection{Moving}
This day was mainly used to move out of the house. Some people came over to register all damage and to take MSH properties.
\subsection{Hotel}
Got a very nice hotell room. Awsome.
\subsection{Halloween Barbeque}
After moving in to the hotel I had a barbeque at Simen & Tom's. Met a woman named Veronica. Don't remember their names.
\subsection{Lost}
Was late. 11:00PM. After getting a lift from the pregnant woman and her boyfriend I got a taxi. The memo techniques works quite well. "Son of a Tibetian" wich helped med remember 'Sonatib', wich is were my hotel is located at. I got lost unfortunaly. After getting quite worried I called Felix. I really got a lost feeling right before. I wasnt sure about what to do.
Then out of the blue I was right outside. The taxi driver knew about the hotel, but didn't know the name. "Classic Hotell".
