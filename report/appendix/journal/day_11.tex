\subsection{Setting up for Development}
There's a slow internet connection here. This is something thats significantly slows down the process in generel. I download in general about 50kB/s tops. Upload seems to be the same. The eclipse set-up seem to work fine. Got some errors with the maven plugin for eclipse. So I decided to run maven outside eclipse and then import it in. We use bazar as version control. I had a unicode problem when trying to push our branch to the server.
\subsection{Meeting with Edith}
Time: 02:00PM, I got a meeting with Edith later to discuss setting up an SMPP account with MTN (the local teleoperator). Hopefully will get to the bottom of this. A previous master student, `Magnus', tried to set this up, but he was met with indecision I think. We agreed that Edith should make arrangements for a SMPP Gateway. How i'm really not sure. Hope that it will get done.
