\subsection{Last Day}
I think me and Simen is going to develop the GUI for the web application. At least this is a start. Hopefully this will keep on going for some time. I need to get familiar with SPRING and CAMEL. This will enable me to understand the code in Bob's prject. Also Apache Maven wich is used for dependencies. It all comes together now. I need to look at this as an ongoing process. 
\subsection{Spring}
I've decided to get familiar with Spring. Are some good getting started at their website. Looks like I could use this as well when I'm making websites :).
