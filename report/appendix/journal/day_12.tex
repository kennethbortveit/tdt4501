\subsection{Continuing setting up IDE}
We will use Eclipse. Everyting should be ready. I encountered a problem building the project with Maven. There were some test's that would produce some errors.
When we skipped the test's, everything seems to work. We agreed with Randy that we will work on Interoperateability. Also agreed with Eric that this is what we shall be working on. Hopefully we'll starrt on monday.
