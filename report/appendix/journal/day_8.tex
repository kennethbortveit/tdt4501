\subsection{Zero Values}
Today we got working on fixing  a database that had accedently deleted some 0's. Randy want to delete all zeroes from a specific date and then insert the ones from the last week or so. I thought this should be done directly with the database. This worked fine, but resulted in dates being placed instead of a NULL. I think this is very wrong. Should probably mention that we had a problem with the dataset. The booleans and the dates where not always present. This caused POSTGRESQL to stop when we tried to import the data. So Randy filled in all the empty values. This resulted in the same way as the other way.
