\subsection{Data Flow Diagram}
I decided to make a Data Flow Diagram today. This will give me an overview of the system as a whole.
I found out today that the DIDDT web application we wanted to make was already taken care of.
So now I am kind of on square one. I will try to get an overview of the whole system, one for how the system is today
and then one for how the system should look like.
I've decided to use Yourdon \& Coad notation. See article. This will allow us to map the intire system down to psudeocode and all the way up to context view.
