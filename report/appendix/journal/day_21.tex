\subsection{Android Development}
I began training for Android development today.
Should make this and web sites a daily practice.
\subsection{Town}
Went to the city center today. Got a bad price on the taxi.
I wasn't willing to walk away, really I should do better.
Anyway, bought some cool stuff for the family. Should get some more for Jan, Victoria, Cecilie and Susanne.
First thing I did alone down here. Should get better at that. Do stuff on my own.
